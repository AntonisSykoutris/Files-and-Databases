The Payroll of the University of Crete deals with the payment of salaries, allowances and other fees to University staff. The staff is permanent employees and contractors. The following personnel categories are also distinguished: administrative staff and teaching staff. Guess these guys are distinguished between them, i.e. someone cannot be both a permanent employee and a contract worker or he is simultaneously a member of both the administrative and the teaching staff. Every employee
receives a base salary and possibly some benefits.
